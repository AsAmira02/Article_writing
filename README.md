# Article_writing
As part of my virtual internship with Data Glacier, one of the tasks was to write an article about a topic of my choice in Data Science and machine learning in particular.
I choose to talk about the famous Gradient Descent algorithm since it represents the core of Optimization algorithms in machine learning. 
I hope you enjoy reading and feel free to send me your reviews and comments.
